## WIP

Allow user to Oauth with Discord.

User can answer random quizz questions, time restrictions, automatic validation...

If user have answered a quizz corectly he can send a folder to be accepted by the staff.

The end of the process is still in WIP and have to be connected to a discord bot. (Probably with https request)
